# Data Exchange Exercise

This is an exercise in working with a json file. The file includes soccer player's infromation. I will write a program that prints out the names of each player who has played as goal keeper (TW, Towart in german). The names printed must be in alphabetical order, some players appear more than once in the data file so my program must also compensate for duplicate entries, and only print out each person's name once.
